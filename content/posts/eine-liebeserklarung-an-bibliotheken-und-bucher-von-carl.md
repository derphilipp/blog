> Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our
> ancestors. The library connects us with the insights and knowledge,
> painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were,
> with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all of
> our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make
> our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species.
> Public libraries depend on voluntary contributions. I think the health
> of our civilization, the depth of our awareness about the
> underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future can all be
> tested by how well we support our libraries.
