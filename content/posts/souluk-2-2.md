this are the resaults of the second part of the shooting with my uncle
for his new album. i used my old nikon f50 with my nikkor 1.8/50mm prime
lens. what a stunning team. i really love it. i cannot understand how
people cannot love analog grain. rodinal is my developer...and i hope it
will be like that for some more years. it even survived agfa...so lets
hope for it...
