i kind of get addicted to Hitchcock movies. it's not just the stories
and the way he saw things...its his perfect views and aesthetics. he was
a nerd for sure...and if i see scenes like this i seriously get infected
by his style. my wife and me started this project...to watch all
Hitchcock movies...and for sure this is a big project. but i cant wait
to see them all.

we got tons of books about Hitchcock's art from the library. there is a
lot of stuff to discover.
