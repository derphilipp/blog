when i developed the latest 35mm film i saw that it still had some
winter impressions on it i shot even two winters ago...i think they came
out nice...

every winter i walked an hour to work...through the woods. i really
enjoyed that time. it meant i could listen to some athmospheric music
and feel the loneliness. a few times some deer crossed my way. i loved
it. a few times i took one of my cameras with me and did a few pictures.
i almost forgot about these...
