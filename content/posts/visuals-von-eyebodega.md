Was für schöne Visuals aus dem Studio von
[EyeBodega](http://www.eyebodega.com/) aus New York. Die visuelle
Untermalung für Tracks von den Young Prisms und Mother Ganga. Ich tauche
mal kurz ab...

> EyeBodega is a multi-disciplinary New York City design studio founded
> by Rob Chabebe and Joe Perez. We work in a variety of visual media
> ranging from print to interactive to video. We challenge ourselves and
> our audience with experiences that have been flatteringly described as
> “post-apocalyptic modernism.” We create work for a large cross-section
> of publications, musicians, DIY holes in walls, and art museums.
